												<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>
													
													<p><u>Length of Membership, Time on App, and Average Session Length</u> <br />
														After conducting some exploratory data analysis on our initial features, we discovered that 
														<em>Length of Membership</em>, <em>Time on App</em>, and <em>Average Session Length</em> are 
														three features which appear to be linearly correlated with our target variable
														<em>yearly spending</em>. Therefore, these three features should be considered canidate predictor variables
														when building our linear regression model.</p>
														<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/ThreeFeatures.PNG" alt="" /></a> <br />

													 <p><u>Avg. Session Length as an accounted feature makes a significant difference</u> <br />
														Based on our EDA scatterplots, I would have guessed that <em>Avg. Session Length</em> was the least predictive feature
														compared to our other two features of <em>Length of Membership</em> and <em>Time on App</em>. However, when you 
														actually build the model both with and without <em>Avg. Session Length</em>, you generate
														significantly different results.</p>

														<em>Accuracy plot, metrics scoring table, and residual plot without Avg. Session Length</em>

														<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/TwoFeatures_Combined.png" alt="" /></a>

														<br />
														<em>Accuracy plot, metrics scoring table, and residual plot with Avg. Session Length</em>

														<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/ThreeFeatures_Combined.png" alt="" /></a>
														<br />

													 <p>With all three evaluation rubrics, we see that involving the <em>Avg. Session length</em> feature 
														improves our model significantly. Specfically, we have our accuracy plot resemble a simple
														linear line more closely, we lower our root mean square error (RSME) score by approx 17.15, and our 
														residual plot has a much smaller range in residual values. <br /> </p> <br/ >

												 <p><u>Coefficients Table : App vs Website</u> <br /> <br />

													Based on the following coefficients table:<br />
													<img src="images/CoeffTable.PNG" height="150"> <br />
													We have that if we were to keep all other variables constant... <br />
													One unit of increase in Time on App would yield $37.89 yearly spending. <br />
													One unit of increase in Length of Membership would yield $61.65 yearly spending. <br />
													One unit of increase in Average Session Length would yield $25.69 yearly spending. <br />
													One unit of increase in Time on Website would yield $0.56 yearly spending. <br /> <br />

													In terms of an actionable interpretation, we can view this problem in two ways. One, the website is not developed enough
													and therefore additional resources ought to be allocated to improve the revenue stream coming from website. Or, two, the
													app is much more of a predictor for revenue, and therefore is more deserving of resource investment. <br /> <br />
													Thus, our recomendation to management would be that further analysis must be conducted to precisely generate a solution
													to the resource allocation problem. For example, conducting internal quality analyis testing to determine the room for improvement
													on both platforms, the associated costs, and how beneficial every dollar of investment would be.
