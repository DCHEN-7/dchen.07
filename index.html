									<p><b>Key Takeaways:</b></p>

									<p><u>Monetary's Extreme Outlier</u> <br />
										When building boxplots for the RFM metrics to identify outliers, we came across an extreme outlier for Monetary.
										This outlier here has a monetary score of 77183.6, or alternatively, possesses a Z-score of 65.5. Based on the staggering
										amount of standard deviation, it almost looks like a data entry error. However, given that the dataset has already gone
										through several cleaning workflows, its origins might not be so straightforward,
										and it is worth investigating how this data point came to be. That being said, for our model's sake, we have to remove it as 
										this point would easily cause our model to begin overfitting.  <br />

										<br />

										<p><u>Optimal Number of Clusters</u> <br />
											Based on the elbow method WCSS plot, we identify the inflection point at k=4, and therefore, our optimal number of
											clusers is 4.  <br />

											<p><u>RFM Cluster Scores & Analysis</u> <br />
												After building our segmentation model, we calculate the average RFM scores for each cluster group.<br />
												<img src="images/CS_RFM_Dashboard.png" height="500"> <br />
	
												Kindly  remember that the recency metric is slightly inverted: <em>Recency</em> represents how <em>recently</em> they made their purchase by tracking the number of days
												<u>since their last purchase</u>. In other words, a high recency score means many days have passed since their last purchase.
												Similarly, a low recency score means they are recent customers.
												The others are straightforward metrics, Frequency means how 
													<em>frequently </em> they make purchases and Monetary means how <em>much</em> they're spending with their purchases. <br />

											<br /> <p style="color:green;">Cluster 1</p> <p>Ranks low in recency, relatively high in frequency, and moderate in monetary. This cluster likely represents
											the customers who are actively engaged with our products, but their monetary value suggests this group
											also tends to make value-concious spending decisions. </p>

											<br /> <p style="color:purple;">Cluster 2</p> <p>Ranks high in recency, low in frequency, and relatively low in monetary. 
												This cluster likely represents the customers who were unsatifsied with our product and are actively disinterested in our current 
											offerings and or promotional deals. </p>

											<br /> <p style="color:orange;">Cluster 3</p> <p>Ranks low in recency, extremely high in frequency, and low in monetary. 
												This cluster likely represents the customers who make purchases recently and regularly, but who strongly graviate towards
											lower spending choices. For exmaple, regularly shopping for lower-priced items while keeping a keen eye for discounts or clearance deals. </p>

											<br /> <p style="color:blue;">Cluster 4</p> <p>Ranks moderate in recency, low-moderate in frequency, and extremely high in monetary. 
												This cluster likely represents our high-value customers who show strong interest in our expensive premimum products and 
												are most willing to spend more money than any other customer group.   </p> <br />

												<p><u>Product Development Team Recommendations</u> <br />
											<p><em>1. Product Bundles</em> <br /> </p>

											<p>Targeting cluster 1, we could research into the top 3 most commonly purchased items within this group and then offer a 
												bundle purchase promotion where one item from the premier group is paired with a <em>slightly</em> less commonly bought items within this group. 
												The goal here is not trying to get this consumer group to purchase a new product, but rather incentivize them to
												purchase a product they typically would wait longer on. Additionally, based on the higher monetary score, we could experiment
												with item pricing combinations within this group to determine the optimal selling point.

												<p><em>2. Root Cause Analysis</em> <br /> </p>

												<p>Targeting cluster 2, we could designate a team to research each and every one of the purchase orders made by cluster 2
													and identify patterns and trends which correlate or perhaps even provide a causal explanation regarding why the customer
													was disinterested in returning for another purchase.

													<p><em>3. Engagement Products</em> <br /> </p>

													<p>Targeting cluster 3, we could design exclusive limited-time offer thank them for being a loyal customer, and then additionally
														provide discounts on typically higher-priced items they otherwise normally wouldn't consider due to the cost. The tricky
														part to this strategy, however, is that even with thorough research, it would be difficult to determine which products
														this consumer group has strayed away from due to complete disinterest versus which products have been shelved simply
														due to its price. If we had the right cookies enabled on our platform then it could be possible to identify items in which
														the user has placed into their cart, but not purchased as a guideline. 

														<p><em>4. VIP Programs</em> <br /> </p>

														<p>Targeting cluster 4, we could implement extra privileges to this consumer group which enhances their 
															customer experience and or provides a sense of exclusivity. For example, we could borrow from Artizia's
															"Clientele" program and slowly rollout the newest and best-selling products in waves, with this consumer group
															being first-in-line. Either way, some form of promotional offer which facilities a strong sense of pride
															within the customer.

					<h4>Building the customer segmentation model in Python...</h4>
					<div class = "box">
						<p>The customer segmentation workflow can essentially be summarized in the following 7 key steps (excluding sub-steps): <br />
							1. Transform the data as necessary (e.g. aggregate, new fields, etc.) in order to obtain the RFM scores. <br />
							2. Obtain the RFM scores and merge them to create one final RFM dataset  <br />
							3. Clean the RFM dataset, identifying and adressing duplicates, null values, outliers, etc. <br />
							4. Standarize the dataset (we'll use StandardScaler from SKLearn) <br />
							5. Determine the optimal number of clustering groups (we'll use Elbow Method) <br />
							6. Visualize the clusters in the manner most suitable for interpretation <br />
							7. Interpret and contexualize the resulting model in terms of business operation & strategy
