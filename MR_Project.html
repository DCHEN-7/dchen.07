						<h4><u>Objects of Interest: Gain insights and understanding of the used car market <br />from the perspective of an interested roofing company</u> <br /> </h4>
					Here is the inital .csv, but where do we begin? <br />
					<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/rawdata.PNG" alt="" /></a></small>

					<p>Well, roofing companies want lots of space. So a good start is to clean and analyze our data for larger vehicles.
					That being said how do we define larger vehicles? We have total of 31 unique body types. Since the number of unique body types is relatively small,
				  we can manually research which vehicles are suitable. We define this set as the <em>larger vehicles</em>. </p>
				  <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/LargerVehiclesSet.PNG" alt="" /></a>
				  <hr>
				<p>Since we want to focus only on these defined larger vehicles, let's create a subset of the inital data with which
					we can then clean and begin to analyze... <br />
					<p>

						1. Delete the rows which held body types that were not part of our larger vehicle set <br />
						2. Removed any duplicates through Excel's built in duplicate removal feature<br />
						3. Remove any rows with <em>NULL</em> "Kilometers", "Price", "Body Type" since they are crucial pieces of information.<br />
						4. Cleaned the gas consumption columns into simple integers, using the average value when given a range
						<hr>
						<p><code>I used VBA for task 4, but if the dataset were larger I'd likely use Python Pandas or SQL.
						</code> <a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/CleanGasUsage.PNG" alt="" /></a></p>
						<hr>
						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/PriceSpread.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						<hr>
				

					<p>With the subset data cleaned to a reasonable degree, we can then generate this dashboard focusing on market share, 
						average price, and the purchasing power of our budget, all categorized by body type:<br />
						<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/ExcelCompleteDashboard.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						<h6>*The purchasing power percentages were calculated within MySQL through CTEs:</h6>
						WITH cte_filtered AS (SELECT Body_Type, Price FROM used_cars_truck.price_data WHERE price <= 60000), <br />
						cte_count AS (Select Body_Type, COUNT(Body_Type) AS "ListingsUnder60000" from cte_filtered group by Body_Type), <br />
						cteTotal AS (Select Body_Type, COUNT(Body_Type) AS "TotalListings" from used_cars_truck.price_data group by Body_Type) <br />
						SELECT cte_count.Body_Type, cte_count.ListingsUnder60000, cteTotal.TotalListings, (ListingsUnder60000/TotalListings) AS "Percentage Within Budget" from cte_count join cteTotal on cte_count.Body_Type = cteTotal.Body_Type; <h6>*Terrible for efficiency but was a great SQL exercise</h6>
						<hr> 

						<div class = "box">
						<p> We see that there are two leading body types which dominate the market: "Truck" and "Crew Cab"
							with a staggering 52.13% and 34.84%, respectively. Another way to see this disparity, group together all the larger vehicles outside of
							 the top 2 and they together only make up 13.03% of the listings.</p>

					<p>
							Furthermore, even if we strip away percentages from the question, we see that "Truck" stands at the top with exactly 956 listings,
							 still relatively far ahead of "Crew Cabs" following behind with 639;
							yet the third highest body type, "Regular Cab", is practically a rare sighting with a listing total of 67.
					</p>

					<p>It is worth noting that not only does this analysis give us valuable insight into the current market of what we consider
						used larger vehicles, but also that any body type class not named "Truck" or "Crew Cab" is not worth analyzing independently in this case study simply due to
						the low number of data regarding them.
					</div>
						<div class = "box">
							<p> In terms of the average price and purchasing power visualization, we see that the average price of Crew Cab's far exceed the rest of the body types. Through this visualization,
								 we gain the insight that with our current
								budget of $60,000, we can only consider a small portion of the Crew Cabs, specifically only 22.6% of the bottom-priced listings. Meanwhile for Trucks,
								our purchasing power looks stronger with us having the budget to consider 55.1% of the total truck listings.</p>
								
								<p>With the remaining body types
								of such low count value, the only thing we can really say is that our budget seems to cover the majority of the rare listings
								 of vehicles not named "Crew Cab"
								 or "Truck".</p>
